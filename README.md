# Gentoo support overlay for RuyiSDK

This is an overlay providing various RuyiSDK products, for Gentoo users'
convenience.

> [!NOTE]
> While `ruyi` likely works well on Gentoo, Gentoo is *not* an officially
> supported distribution by the RuyiSDK product. Specifically, binary packages
> provided in the RuyiSDK software repo may be built against older versions
> of certain ABI-sensitive libraries, and as a result may not run on Gentoo or
> other rolling distributions without manual intervention. Beware!

The following package(s) are available for now:

* `dev-util/ruyi`: [the RuyiSDK Package Manager][ruyipkg].
